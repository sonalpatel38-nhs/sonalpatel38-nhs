- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sonal (pronounced soh-null)
- ðŸš€ I'm a technology pragmatist (and somewhat purist) at heart, that's currently leading an engineering team in NHS.UK. Iâ€™m all about striving for engineering excellence and gender equity within the NHS.
- ðŸ’– I love python, cloud technologies, and all the boring/interesting tech that's required for strategic engineering!
