- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sonal (pronounced soh-null)
- ðŸš€ I'm all about striving for engineering excellence and gender equity within the NHS, Iâ€™m a technology pragmatist at heart â€” with a touch of purist. Currently, I'm leading an engineering team at NHS.UK.
- ðŸ’– I love python, cloud technologies, and all the boring/interesting tech that's required for strategic engineering!
